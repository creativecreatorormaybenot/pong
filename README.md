# Pong

This is a very simple demonstration of Flutter web using the raw layer.  
It is drawn in just a few lines of Dart, [see `main.dart`][main].

## Demonstration

Watch the [application running in Chrome][demo].

## Run

You can run this demonstration by executing the following commands as [explained here][]:

```
flutter packages get
flutter pub global activate webdev
webdev serve
```

Now, you can view the animation in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
