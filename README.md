# Pong

This is a very simple demonstration of Flutter web using the raw layer.  
It is drawn in just a few lines of Dart, [see `main.dart`](https://github.com/creativecreatorormaybenot/pong/blob/master/lib/main.dart).

## Demonstration

Watch the [application running in Chrome](https://i.imgur.com/bMEaMU8.mp4).

## Run

You can run this demonstration by executing the following commands as [explained here](https://github.com/flutter/flutter_web#getting-stateless-hot-reload-with-webdev):

```
flutter packages get
flutter pub global activate webdev
webdev serve
```

Now, you can view the animation in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
